# Backer

Anyone could become a backer in Nika's game as long as they have at least 6000000000000 Mojo (6 XCH). As you may already guess, the amount of 6 XCH comes up from the sum of the prizes (excluding JackpotPrize). Backers guarantee the winner gets the compensation they deserve.

For their committed XCH in each game, a backer would get the reward. All the backers would get a share of ticket sales of the game they backed. Share percentage can be seen at [Ticket Sales Allocation](/ticket_sales_allocation.html). And that amount will be distributed among backers according to their contribution. Although, there is some game when ticket sales won't cover the amount of the prizes. If that happens, then backers committed amount would be cut proportionally according to their contribution. That means some eligible backers in the current game may be ineligible at the next game.

The more eligible backers the game has, the more exciting the game would be, as it would increase the game's SlotPerNumber. And, since the game would not start when there is no eligible backer, we make sure there's always at least one backer around.
