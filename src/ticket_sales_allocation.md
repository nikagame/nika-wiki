# Ticket Sales Allocation

Each game in Nika is declared profit when XCH collected from ticket sales is more than XCH given for the winner prize, and said loss otherwise. Note that the Jackpot prize is out of this equation since it has its prize pool.

When the game is profit, here is the share percentage where the fund goes:
- 30% for site maintenance.
- 40% for the backers.
- 30% for the Jackpot Pool Prize.
