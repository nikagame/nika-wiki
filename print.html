<p>Welcome to the exciting yet secure game platform built based on <a href="https://www.chia.net/">Chia Blockchain Platform</a>. This wiki intends to provide some basic information about nika-play.com.</p>
<p>If you have any unanswered questions about nika-play.com, you could join our Discord server.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="game-rules"><a class="header" href="#game-rules">Game Rules</a></h1>
<p>Game in Nika is a form of play in predefined set of time which player try to guess some number which will appear at the end of the game, and will get the reward if their guess is correct.</p>
<h1 id="1-duration"><a class="header" href="#1-duration">1. Duration</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Each game in Nika lasted 120 minutes.</li>
<li>Timezone used is UTC.</li>
<li>There can't be two or more games running simultaneously. It's always one game at a given time.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="2-ticket"><a class="header" href="#2-ticket">2. Ticket</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>One ticket is worth 1000000000 Mojo (0.001 XCH). </li>
<li>One ticket contains one 4-digit number and a 1-digit jackpot number.</li>
<li>To play in Nika, one has to buy the ticket(s).</li>
<li>Each player can buy the ticket(s) as many as they like, but it will be limited by the game's <a href="game_rules.html#7-slotpernumber">SlotPerNumber</a>.</li>
<li>The Chia blockchain address used to buy a ticket would be used as the player's payout address to receive any prize.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="3-result"><a class="header" href="#3-result">3. Result</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Each game would output three pairs of a 4-digit number and one 1-digit number. We call the resulted pair as FirstNumber, SecondNumber, and ThirdNumber. And one 1-digit number is called JackpotNumber.</li>
<li>Each result pair could have duplicated a 4-digit number.</li>
<li>Result is calculated using <a href="/provably_fair.html">provably fair</a> algorithm based on Chia blockchain's Coin ID.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="4-win-condition"><a class="header" href="#4-win-condition">4. Win Condition</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Player is declared the winner if their ticket's number matches the game result.</li>
<li>There is four types of a winner, FirstWinner, SecondWinner, ThirdWinner, and JackpotWinner.</li>
<li>FirstWinner is whose ticket's 4-digit number matches FirstNumber.</li>
<li>SecondWinner is whose ticket's 4-digit number matches SecondNumber.</li>
<li>ThirdWinner is whose ticket's 4-digit number matches ThirdNumber.</li>
<li>JackpotWinner is the FirstWinner whose ticket's 1-digit matches JackpotNumber.</li>
<li>If the game's SlotPerNumber is more than one, it's possible to have multiple winners in each type.</li>
<li>Since a player could buy more than one ticket, then it's possible for one player to declare as every winner type.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="5-prize"><a class="header" href="#5-prize">5. Prize</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>FirstWinner would be rewarded 3000000000000 Mojo (3 XCH).</li>
<li>SecondWinner would be rewarded 2000000000000 Mojo (2 XCH).</li>
<li>ThirdWinner would be rewarded 1000000000000 Mojo (1 XCH).</li>
<li>JackpotWinner would be rewarded by any XCH available in Jackpot Pool Prize.</li>
<li>When there are multiple FirstWinner, SecondWinner, and ThirdWinner in one game, each of them would be rewarded the full amount according to their winning type.</li>
<li>When there are multiple JackpotWinner in one game, the reward from Jackpot Pool Prize would be distributed equally among JackpotWinners.</li>
<li>Every prize is immediately sent to the winner's payout address after the game end.</li>
<li>At the end of each game, the jackpot pool prize is calculated first according to <a href="/ticket_sales_allocation.html">Ticket Sales Allocation</a>, then distributed to the JackpotWinners for that game, if there are any.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="6-backer"><a class="header" href="#6-backer">6. Backer</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Each game needs at least one eligible backer to be started. When there is none, then the game will not start.</li>
<li>Backer is declared eligible when they commit 6000000000000 Mojo (6 XCH) or more.</li>
<li>Any profit or loss that happens in one game would be distributed according to their backing amount.</li>
<li>Profit sharing reward immediately sent to backer's payout address after the game end.</li>
<li>Backer would take loss sharing from their committed XCH after the game end.</li>
<li>Withdrawal of committed XCH would be processed and sent to the backer's payout address after the game end.</li>
<li>Backer's committed amount would be recalculated at the end of the game, so their eligibility may be changed in the next game.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="7-slotpernumber"><a class="header" href="#7-slotpernumber">7. SlotPerNumber</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>SlotPerNumber is calculated before the game starts and will not change until the game is finished.</li>
<li>SlotPerNumber is calculated by dividing the game's backed amount by the total prize amount, which is 6000000000000 Mojo (6 XCH).</li>
<li>If the divide operation has a remainder, it will be floored.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="8-reserved-ticket"><a class="header" href="#8-reserved-ticket">8. Reserved Ticket</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Reserved ticket is automatically created when a player purchases a ticket for the 4-digit number already bought up to the current game's SlotPerNumber.</li>
<li>Reserved tickets would be used to purchase a ticket with the same number in the next games.</li>
<li>Ticket purchasing from reserved tickets would be executed before the game.</li>
<li>Coin ID used to calculate a game result for the ticket purchased by the reserved ticket is the Coin ID for the original transaction.</li>
<li>Reserved ticket is sorted by the transaction height in the Chia blockchain. The smaller the height, the sooner it will be executed.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="9-transaction-confirmations"><a class="header" href="#9-transaction-confirmations">9. Transaction Confirmations</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Confirmation means the Chia's block where the transaction happened is buried with another block.</li>
<li>The more considerable the amount, the more confirmation is needed for transactions confirmed by the game.</li>
<li>For any transaction below 1 XCH, ten confirmation is needed.</li>
<li>For any transaction above or equal to 1 XCH, the following rules apply:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>minConfirmation = ((amountInMojo / 10000000000000) + 2) * 10
Divide operation executed as integer division, which means the result is floored.
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="provably-fair"><a class="header" href="#provably-fair">Provably Fair</a></h1>
<p>Anyone can repeatedly calculate every result in Nika games, but the result is always consistent. There's no way to know the outcome of future games, hence Provably Fair.</p>
<p>As stated in the <a href="/game_rules.html#2-ticket">rules</a>, a player must buy a ticket to participate in Nika games. Ticket purchasing happens in the Chia blockchain, which produces a unique Coin ID. So each game will have its own set of Coin IDs. To calculate the game result, one has to append all the Coin IDs for the said game (in hex format, with 0x prefix), then hash it with SHA-256. Take the hash result in decimal representation, and then:</p>
<ul>
<li>FirstNumber = First to the fourth character of the result.</li>
<li>SecondNumber = Fifth to the eighth character of the result.</li>
<li>ThirdNumber = Ninth to the twelfth character of the result.</li>
<li>JackpotNumber = Thirteenth character of the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how to prove it <a href="/how_to_calculate_game_result.html">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="backer"><a class="header" href="#backer">Backer</a></h1>
<p>Anyone could become a backer in Nika's game as long as they have at least 6000000000000 Mojo (6 XCH). As you may already guess, the amount of 6 XCH comes up from the sum of the prizes (excluding JackpotPrize). Backers guarantee the winner gets the compensation they deserve.</p>
<p>For their committed XCH in each game, a backer would get the reward. All the backers would get a share of ticket sales of the game they backed. Share percentage can be seen at <a href="/ticket_sales_allocation.html">Ticket Sales Allocation</a>. And that amount will be distributed among backers according to their contribution. Although, there is some game when ticket sales won't cover the amount of the prizes. If that happens, then backers committed amount would be cut proportionally according to their contribution. That means some eligible backers in the current game may be ineligible at the next game.</p>
<p>The more eligible backers the game has, the more exciting the game would be, as it would increase the game's SlotPerNumber. And, since the game would not start when there is no eligible backer, we make sure there's always at least one backer around.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="report"><a class="header" href="#report">Report</a></h1>
<p>After the game end, it would create a report that anyone could download and open. Its format is Excel Workbook with .xlsx extension. It contains five sheets of information about the game. All amount described in the report is in Mojo format.</p>
<h2 id="game-sheet"><a class="header" href="#game-sheet">Game Sheet</a></h2>
<p>General information about the game itself. </p>
<h2 id="eligible-backer-sheet"><a class="header" href="#eligible-backer-sheet">Eligible Backer Sheet</a></h2>
<p>List of all backers for this game that are eligible. This report shows their profit (or loss) in this game and their withdrawal, if there's any.</p>
<h2 id="ineligible-backer-sheet"><a class="header" href="#ineligible-backer-sheet">Ineligible Backer Sheet</a></h2>
<p>List of all backers for this game that are ineligible. This report shows their balance when this game started and their withdrawal if any.</p>
<h2 id="ticket-sheet"><a class="header" href="#ticket-sheet">Ticket Sheet</a></h2>
<p>List of all tickets purchased during this game. It's sorted like when used for calculating game <a href="/provably_fair.html">result</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reserved-ticket-sheet"><a class="header" href="#reserved-ticket-sheet">Reserved Ticket Sheet</a></h2>
<p>List of all reserved tickets that were created during this game or the game before. This list will be used in the next game to purchase tickets in the next game automatically.</p>
<h2 id="winner-sheet"><a class="header" href="#winner-sheet">Winner Sheet</a></h2>
<p>List of all winners in this game, along with their payout address.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ticket-sales-allocation"><a class="header" href="#ticket-sales-allocation">Ticket Sales Allocation</a></h1>
<p>Each game in Nika is declared profit when XCH collected from ticket sales is more than XCH given for the winner prize, and said loss otherwise. Note that the Jackpot prize is out of this equation since it has its prize pool.</p>
<p>When the game is profit, here is the share percentage where the fund goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% for site maintenance.</li>
<li>40% for the backers.</li>
<li>30% for the Jackpot Pool Prize.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="requirement"><a class="header" href="#requirement">Requirement</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain">Chia Blockchain wallet</a>
To play, you don't need Chia Blockchain's full node. Its wallet is sufficient, so make sure to switch to &quot;Wallet Mode&quot; when starting the client. Your wallet address will be used as a Payout Address to receive the prize. If you use an exchange wallet to play, there's no guarantee your prize will land in your account, so DO NOT USE EXCHANGE WALLET.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pick-the-killer-number"><a class="header" href="#pick-the-killer-number">Pick the killer number</a></h1>
<p>Choosing the right number is the key point to winning the game. So, use your full mind when picking one. Interpret your dream, look for any hidden sign on your way back from work, calculate your birth constellation or whatever works. The main keyword is never given up trying! Luck will follow you somehow. To get started you could read <a href="https://www.eastrohelp.com/blog/lottery-astrology-for-jackpot/">this</a> and <a href="https://freehoroscopesastrology.weebly.com/blog/astrology-lottery-prediction">that</a>.</p>
<p>For this guide, let's suppose your name is John Lucky Doe, and your birth date is January 1st, 2001. So, according to <a href="https://www.prokerala.com/numerology/lucky-numbers.php">this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Life Path Number: 5
Destiny Number: 8
Soul Urge Number: 2
Inner Dream Number: 6
Personality Number: 6
</code></pre>
<p>We could mix and match this number from this information until you get the correct number. If you are the &quot;all or nothing&quot; kind of guy, you could choose all the possible permutations and buy 10 tickets for each number!</p>
<p>Let's say you have this motto in your life:</p>
<pre><code>My inner dream would guide my destiny and life path
My soul urge would define my personality
</code></pre>
<p>You would pick 6852 as a 4-digit number and 6 as a 1-digit jackpot number. Let's proceed with that.</p>

<p>Before you buy that killer ticket, it is advised that you check if the number is already reserved or not. So you can manage your expectation and the timing for your luck. To do so, you could go to the &quot;Reserved Ticket&quot; section on nika-play.com.</p>
<!-- <p><img src="images/test_picture.jpg" alt="Reserved Ticket" /></p> -->
<p>Nice! There is no other human being named John Lucky Doe who came to this world at the start of the millennium. Or, he doesn't use the right tool as you do!</p>
<p>Anyway, suppose your other killer number happens to be reserved by another player. In that case, you could still buy the ticket with the same number. You would be joining the waiting list for that number. Your ticket will be purchased immediately when other players' slots run out.</p>

<p>At the top of nika-play.com, you will see the &quot;BUY YOUR TICKET NOW&quot; box. Input our 4-digit number in the &quot;NUMBER&quot; textbox and our 1-digit number in the &quot;JACKPOT&quot; textbox. And press the &quot;BUY TICKET&quot; button afterward. Copy the resulted address.</p>

<li>Go to the &quot;SEND&quot; tab in your wallet. </li>
<li>Paste the address you get from the previous step in the &quot;Address / Puzzle hash&quot; textbox.</li>
<li>The price for one ticket is <a href="/game_rules.html#2-ticket">0.001 XCH</a>, so if you want to buy 10 tickets for this number, you will input 0.01 in the &quot;Amount&quot; textbox.</li>

According to this <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/discussions/10379#discussioncomment-2231974">comment</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/blob/d87b8ac08766c9cbb4f4577a4819bb592f63123c/chia/full_node/mempool_manager.py#L99">comment in the codebase</a>, it's safe to input 0.00005 as the fee to make sure our transaction get through.</li>
<li>Wait for the transaction to become &quot;Confirmed&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="monitor-the-transaction"><a class="header" href="#monitor-the-transaction">Monitor the transaction</a></h1>
<p>As stated in the <a href="/game_rules.html#9-transaction-confirmations">rules</a>, all transaction need some confirmation before it's get accepted. You could monitor this at &quot;LAST 20 TRANSACTIONS&quot; on the home screen of nika-play.com.</p>
<p>This means our transaction needs 10 confirmations before it gets accepted. If your transaction is already buried by another transaction, you could always search it. The most straightforward term to search is the &quot;To Address&quot; since we know where our fund is sent in advance.</p>
<h1 id="verify-your-ticket"><a class="header" href="#verify-your-ticket">Verify your ticket</a></h1>
<p>When your transaction has already been accepted, you should see your ticket at &quot;LAST 20 TICKETS&quot; on the home screen of nika-play.com. You could search for it too if you want.</p>
<p>Since current game's <a href="/game_rules.html#7-slotpernumber">SlotPerNumber</a> is 1, you would only see 1 ticket at this game. You could verify another 9 tickets are reserved for you by going to the &quot;Reserved Ticket&quot; section and searching &quot;6852&quot; in the provided textbox. And then you could come back at the next game to see your ticket automatically purchased for you.</p>
<h1 id="wait-for-the-game-to-end"><a class="header" href="#wait-for-the-game-to-end">Wait for the game to end</a></h1>
<p>Besides waiting, you could do what people suggested <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-method-of-winning-the-lottery-using-spiritual-methods-Please-read-my-comment-below">here</a> (ignore the negative comment!) and then check your Chia Wallet balance afterward. If you did it right and it happened to be one of your many lucky days to win FirstPrize, you would be 3 XCH richer! Now, imagine when the game has 10 <a href="/game_rules.html#7-slotpernumber">SlotPerNumber</a>, you would be 30 XCH richer, just for 0.01 XCH! It means you just double your XCH 3000 times! I love you 3000!</p>
<p>And yes, we haven't talked about <a href="/game_rules.html#5-prize">JackpotPrize</a> yet, which can be any amount of XCH!</p>

<p>There's a time when lady luck doesn't come in your favor. Keep that chin of yours up! Like the one American Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, said:</p>

<h1 id="requirement-1"><a class="header" href="#requirement-1">Requirement</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain">Chia Blockchain wallet</a>
To back the game, you don't need Chia Blockchain's full node, and its wallet is sufficient, so make sure to switch to &quot;Wallet Mode&quot; when starting the client. Your wallet address will be used as a Payout Address to receive the profit reward. If you use an exchange wallet to back the game, there's no guarantee your profit share will land in your account, so DO NOT USE EXCHANGE WALLET.</li>
<li>Chia balance &gt; 6 XCH
Please read this to figure out why we choose six.</li>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> account
We value privacy and anonymity, so we use Discord as the mean of communication between the backer and our server. We only collect user IDs and usernames from your account and will not share them with any party. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="join-our-server"><a class="header" href="#join-our-server">Join our server</a></h1>
<p>Please make sure you have already joined our server. There is where your adventure for profit begins.</p>
<h1 id="summon-the-bot"><a class="header" href="#summon-the-bot">Summon the bot</a></h1>
<p>In the &quot;general&quot; channel, summon the bot by sending:</p>
<pre><code>!bot
</code></pre>
<p>The bot will approach you by a direct message to start interacting with you. Or, if you want to avoid any suspicion of your account, you could DM-ing the bot directly. They (yes, this bot declaring their pronouns as they/them) would respond appropriately.</p>
<h1 id="ask-for-a-top-up-address"><a class="header" href="#ask-for-a-top-up-address">Ask for a top up address</a></h1>
<p>Now you have slid in the bot's DM, send:</p>
<pre><code>backer start
</code></pre>
<p>to get started. This friendly bot would respond to ask you to wait while they notice our server to get a unique Chia address just for you.</p>
<h1 id="choosing-your-backing-amount"><a class="header" href="#choosing-your-backing-amount">Choosing your backing amount</a></h1>
<p>While you are waiting for that excellent bot, here is some consideration to choose how much you would commit to back the game. As you may already know, when you dedicate 6 XCH, you create 1 SlotPerNumber in the game, but it doesn't mean the amount must be a multiplier of six. You could choose any amount above 6 to increase your share of the game's profit.</p>
<h1 id="send-the-xch"><a class="header" href="#send-the-xch">Send the XCH</a></h1>
<p>After you decide how many XCH you will send, hopefully, the bot has already come back with your address. Now it's time to send it to start back the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the &quot;SEND&quot; tab in your wallet. </li>
<li>Paste the address you get from the bot in the &quot;Address / Puzzle hash&quot; textbox.</li>
<li>Input your chosen amount in the &quot;Amount&quot; textbox.</li>
<li>As for now, there's no definite guide to setting acceptable fees in Chia. According to this <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/discussions/10379#discussioncomment-2231974">comment</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/blob/d87b8ac08766c9cbb4f4577a4819bb592f63123c/chia/full_node/mempool_manager.py#L99">comment in the codebase</a>, it's safe to input 0.00005 as the fee to make sure our transaction get through.</li>
<li>Wait for the transaction to become &quot;Confirmed&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="monitor-the-transaction-1"><a class="header" href="#monitor-the-transaction-1">Monitor the transaction</a></h1>
<p>As stated in the <a href="/game_rules.html#9-transaction-confirmations">rules</a>, all transaction need some confirmation before it's get accepted. You could monitor this at &quot;LAST 20 TRANSACTIONS&quot; on the home screen of nika-play.com.</p>
<p>This means our transaction needs ten confirmations before it gets accepted. If another transaction already buries your transaction, you could always search it. The most straightforward term to search is the &quot;To Address&quot; since we know where we sent our fund in advance.</p>
<p>But, if you don't have time for this, worry none. That excellent bot will inform you when your fund is accepted.</p>
<h1 id="enjoy-the-profit"><a class="header" href="#enjoy-the-profit">Enjoy the profit</a></h1>
<p>We can't guide you on how to do this tough. You can add another yacht to your collection, claim 70% of Google's ownership, or create a full-blown casino. But you could always buy a Nika's game ticket to make a game more exciting and potentially double your &quot;already colossal&quot; profit. </p>
<h1 id="monitor-your-backing-activity"><a class="header" href="#monitor-your-backing-activity">Monitor your backing activity</a></h1>
<p>While you are busy spending that never-ending profit, you could get a recap of your backing activity by contacting the bot again. Just type:</p>
<pre><code>backer info
</code></pre>
<p>They will calculate all the information regarding your contribution to the games. </p>
<h1 id="increase-your-backing-amount"><a class="header" href="#increase-your-backing-amount">Increase your backing amount</a></h1>
<p>We understand your insatiable ambition. Please don't feel bad about it. You could always send more XCH to your given address to make your profit even more prominent!</p>
<h1 id="withdraw-your-backed-fund"><a class="header" href="#withdraw-your-backed-fund">Withdraw your backed fund</a></h1>
<p>When time is hard, you can always withdraw your backed fund. In the next game, you would lose some reward (or all your reward if you release all your funds). Please type:</p>
<pre><code>backer withdraw &lt;your_amount_in_mojo&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;your_amount_in_mojo&gt;</code> with the amount you want to withdraw. Your fund will be sent to your wallet when the current game ends.</p>
<p>And then, when life gets easier again, you could always send the Chia address to be a great backer once again. A backer account is never expired.</p>
